**CCC Solutions**
These are my solutions for the Canadian Computing Contest problems. I intend to explain my reasoning and thinking in some videos that I will post at a later date.
**Testing**
As far as testing goes, I don't have access to all the test cases that the CCC uses, so the CCCGrader is your best option. I will include CICD and the sample test case at a later date though, but everything I upload to the master branch of this project should pass all test cases on the CCCGrader.
**Things to note about the CCCGrader / Standard libs**
- Don't use \n, use std::endl;
- Use std::cin only for input
- Remember that std::cin breaks apart inputs at spaces. eg 1 2 3 becomes "1","2","3"
- Only use std::cout, printf might work but I don't trust it.
- The CCCGrader can slow down a lot during contests, try to submit stuff before the end of the contest(it'll be practically DDOSed at that point)
- When there's a contest anywhere, the CCCGrader is taken down for anyone not writing a contest to preserve bandwidth for the people writing
